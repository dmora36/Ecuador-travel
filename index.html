  		<h2> Ecuador: Where Hemispheres Meet and Wonders Begin</h2>
  		<p>Nestled right on the equator—where the Northern and Southern Hemispheres collide—Ecuador is a small country with an extraordinary range of natural and cultural treasures. At the famous Intiñan Museum, visitors can balance an egg on the head of a nail and watch water drain straight down, thanks to the curious gravitational quirks at latitude 0°0'0".</p>

			<p>Despite being roughly the size of Oregon, Ecuador is a land of dramatic contrasts: lush Amazonian rainforests, majestic Andean peaks, sun-kissed Pacific beaches, and the legendary Galápagos Islands. It’s a country that offers something for every traveler.</p>

			<p>I chose Ecuador not only because it is my beloved home, but also because I want to share its beauty, history, and vibrant culture with the world. Through tourism, I hope others will discover why Ecuador is such a special place—and fall in love with it just as I have. </p>

  <h2>History</h2>

    <div class="history-text">
      <p>Ecuador's rich history dates back thousands of years, evolving from isolated indigenous groups into the powerful Inca Empire. In the mid-15th century, leaders like Pachacuti and Topa Yupanqui expanded the Inca's reach into Ecuador, with Huayna Capac eventually uniting the region under Inca control. However, the Inca Empire’s dominance was short-lived. In 1526, Spanish explorers arrived during a period of internal strife and disease. Francisco Pizarro took advantage of the weakened Inca state, capturing and executing Emperor Atahualpa in 1532, leading to the brutal Spanish conquest and colonization of Ecuador. The Spanish ruled for nearly two centuries,establishing Catholicism and colonial architecture while devastating the indigenous population through forced labor and disease. </p>

			<p>Colonial rule began to wane in the early 19th century as Enlightenment ideals and criollo discontent fueled the call for independence. Jose Joaquin Olmedo initiated Ecuador's fight for freedom in 1820, forming a strategic alliance with liberation leaders Simon Bolivar and San Martin. The decisive Battle of Pichincha in 1822, led by General Jose Antonio de Sucre, secured Ecuador’s independence from Spanish rule. Ecuador has grown into one of South America’s top travel destinations, known for its biodiversity, cultural heritage, and ecological diversity across four unique regions.</p>
